# Customer Struct C++
In this program, I created a structure for address information for user and nested the address 
structure within a customer and intialized as customer object. And I created some files to 
valide the user input.
- Street (only accept street number and letters for street name with no special characters)
- City (only accept letters with no numbers or special characters)
- zipCode (only accept only valid zipcode number which is 5 digits with no letters or special chars)
